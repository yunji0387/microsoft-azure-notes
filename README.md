---

### VM availability sets

VM availability sets help in ensuring that your application remains available during network failures, local disk hardware failures, and any unplanned maintenance events.

#### Fault Domain (FD)

A Fault Domain represents a physical unit in a data center, like a server rack. It ensures VMs aren't all on the same hardware, protecting against localized hardware failures.

#### Update Domain (UD)

An Update Domain is a logical grouping ensuring VMs aren't updated simultaneously during maintenance. This prevents all VMs from rebooting at the same time, ensuring service availability.

### Azure Storage Redundancy Overview

Azure Storage ensures data protection by storing multiple copies. This protection safeguards data against events like hardware failures, outages, and natural disasters. The redundancy choice relies on factors like replication methods, regional disasters protection, and data access in case the primary region is down.

## Redundancy in the Primary Region
Azure always replicates data thrice in the primary region. The two main options are:

### Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)
- Replicates data three times within one data center in the primary region.
- Durability: 99.999999999% annually.
- Affordable but riskier due to vulnerability to large-scale disasters.

### Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS)
- Replicates data across three Azure availability zones.
- Durability: 99.9999999999% annually.
- Maintains data accessibility even if a zone is down.

## Redundancy in a Secondary Region
For high durability, data can be replicated to a secondary region distant from the primary. Available options are:

### Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)
- Uses LRS in primary and asynchronously replicates to LRS in a secondary region.
- Durability: 99.99999999999999% annually.

### Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage (GZRS)
- Combines ZRS in primary and LRS in secondary.
- Durability: 99.99999999999999% annually.

### Data Access in Secondary Region
- GRS and GZRS replicate data to another region for regional outages protection.
- Data in secondary is readable only during a failover unless read-access is enabled.
- Options for read access: Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage (RA-GRS) and Read-Access Geo-Zone-Redundant Storage (RA-GZRS).

> **Note**: Data in the secondary region might be outdated due to Recovery Point Objective (RPO).

- **Use cases**: Suitable for data sizes larger than 40 TBs, especially in scenarios with limited network connectivity. This can be used for:
    - **One-time migration**: Move a significant amount of on-premises data to Azure.
    - **Periodic uploads**: Transfer large data to Azure at regular intervals.
    - **Initial bulk transfer**: Do an initial bulk transfer with Data Box followed by incremental transfers over the network.
- **Data export scenarios**: Data Box can also be used to export data from Azure for purposes like disaster recovery, security requirements, or migrating data back to on-premises.

_Note: Once the data is uploaded to Azure, the disks on the device are wiped clean following NIST 800-88r1 standards._

---

## Single Sign-On (SSO)

Allows a user to sign in once and access multiple resources.
- Reduces passwords to remember.
- Simplifies security model.
- Less strain on IT management.

> **Note**: SSO's security is based on the security of the initial authenticator.

## Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

Requires two or more elements to authenticate. Categories:
1. **Something the user knows** - e.g., a challenge question.
2. **Something the user has** - e.g., a code to a mobile phone.
3. **Something the user is** - e.g., fingerprint or face scan.

> MFA limits the impact of credential exposure and provides added security benefits.

## Microsoft Entra Multifactor Authentication

A service offering multifactor authentication with options like phone call or mobile app notifications.

## Passwordless Authentication

Removes password and replaces it with:
1. Something you have (e.g., registered device).
2. Plus something you know or are (e.g., PIN or fingerprint).

**Azure Passwordless Options**:
- **Windows Hello for Business**: Tied to user's PC, supports SSO.
- **Microsoft Authenticator App**: Turns phones into passwordless credentials.
- **FIDO2 Security Keys**: Standards-based passwordless method.

> FIDO2 keys can be USB, Bluetooth, or NFC. They enhance security by eliminating password exposure.
