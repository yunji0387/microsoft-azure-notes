## Virtual Training Notes
### Regions
- **Regions are made up of one or more datacenters in close proximity.**

- **Provide flexibility and scale to reduce customer latency.**

- **Preserve data residency with a comprehensive compliance offering.**

## Availability zones

- **Provide protection against downtime due to datacenter failure**: Availability zones are designed to protect your applications and data from datacenter failures.
  
- **Physically separate datacenters within the same region**: This ensures a high level of resilience and redundancy within a geographical area.

- **Each datacenter is equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking**: This ensures that if one datacenter faces any issues, the other datacenters can still function independently.

- **Connected through private fiber-optic networks**: This ensures fast and secure communication between datacenters.
